### HodlUntilDate
Smart Contract which allows locking any funds received by the address for a specified period of time, unless a second private key is used to unlock some or all of the balance.

### OddOrEvenContestContract
A simple mechanism for determining the winner between 2 addresses.  One address is the "even" address, the other is the "odd" address.
Each address provides a number (usually randomly created), and if the sum of the 2 numbers is even, the "even" address is the winner; and if the sum of the 2 numbers is odd, then the "odd" number is the winner.
